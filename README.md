# What?

This is what I done instead of studying for my exams, It is a Mandelbrot set generator written in Rust and then compiled to WebAssembly.

It you can mess around with it [here](https://mandelbrot.grzegorz.ie/).

# Notes

- This is my first time writing Rust and using WebAssembly, so the code is probably not the best.
- If you run into performance issues, try using a different browser. I found that Chrome is the fastest.
- Turn down the Pixel Scale if you want it to run faster.
